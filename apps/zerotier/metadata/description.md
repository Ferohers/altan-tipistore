## Altan-Tipi Store Experimental Zerotier

The original Tipi store zerotier was plagued by a weird docker-compose file. Any way the real issue with the app was that the app was not able to store its config file. 
The first instance troubled by the process as well. Even everything goes smoothly and you do not aim to restart the app for the next century. It goes offline very quickly. 

It is because the app cannot write the config file and sooner or later checks the config.
